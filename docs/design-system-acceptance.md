# Design-system acceptance — FRALO-5

Implementation scope: Debug-only native development lab and the shared AppKit design system. The existing product workbench and production renderer remain the baseline.

## Executed checks

Verified locally on 2026-10-26 on Apple Silicon. The minimum supported target remains macOS 14; this run does not establish runtime compatibility on every supported OS version.

| Check | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| Debug build and `swift test` | Passed: 31 tests — 11 shared-control tests, 12 core tests, 4 development-isolation tests, 4 updater tests |
| Release build and local package | Passed; ad-hoc packaging only, no publication |
| `scripts/verify_cli.py` | Passed all 10 checks, including isolated settings, partial failure, cancellation and source preservation |
| `scripts/verify_design_system.py` | Debug contains Dev symbols; Release excludes them; shared module compiles for Release; packaged binary matches verified Release code; no Dev fixture resources |
| Runtime probe | All 16 observations passed, with 10 view-cache captures; report bound to the current Debug executable |
| Native window inspection | Five pages reachable; real radio/tab accessibility roles; scenario sliders use full form width; aligned panel edges; local appearance changes and opaque fallback visible |
| Source checks | `git diff --check` and `scripts/check_public_source.py` passed |

The shared-control tests cover no-edit restoration, single selection, disabled/busy behavior, value validation, available slider width, focus transfer from canvas to parameter controls, export action separation, list identity, viewing geometry and reduced-transparency fallback. Development tests cover unchanged isolated product settings, real sample changes, artwork independence from appearance, and motion-page state independence.

The runtime probe covers the developer menu, absence of product import/export actions in the lab menu, fixtures/five pages, collapse geometry and image-size preservation, preview focus/Escape, canvas arrow routing, control arrow isolation, transparent output, accessibility fallback and minimum-window layout. It is an in-process native probe, not a replacement for user input testing.

Native screenshots and process/build provenance are retained outside the source tree with the task's local verification evidence. View-cache captures are layout evidence only: macOS compositing can omit material layers from those images.

## Remaining manual acceptance

- Compare Materials over varied desktop colors and with the window active/inactive. The inspected desktop was neutral; no global wallpaper or accessibility preferences were changed.
- Review selection, sidebar collapse and preview motion in the real window. Compare the local reduced-motion preview.
- Confirm the component styling and the 0/3/100-image scenarios feel suitable for the next workbench stage.
- VoiceOver speech and a complete keyboard traversal have not been accepted. Native roles and selected/disabled values were inspected, and targeted keyboard routing was exercised.
- Actual OS accessibility setting changes and macOS 14 runtime behavior remain untested on this machine. Local stronger-setting previews are not proof of those system transitions.

The implementation is ready for manual review. User acceptance of appearance/motion is still pending; no acceptance, merge, release or subsequent workbench-rewrite authorization is inferred from automated checks.

## How to review

Run `scripts/run-design-lab.sh`, or use **开发 → 设计实验室…** in a Debug build. The shortcut is Command-Option-Shift-D.

1. Browse Components, checking enabled/disabled controls, parameter choices and native tabs.
2. In Materials, compare system materials and local appearance/accessibility previews. The center image should keep its own colors.
3. In Motion and Scenarios, collapse the list and enter/leave clean preview. Use Escape to return and arrow keys to switch images when the canvas/list has focus.
4. In Scenarios, inspect empty/loading/failure states, 100 entries, long names and the export page's PNG/JPEG conditional controls.

Phone examples use the existing core renderer. iPad/browser are labelled layout fixtures. Export actions demonstrate interaction only and write no product files; new production renderers and JPEG export belong to the next task.
